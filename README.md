# Wator Project

### Author
Sam Cullen
## Description
The purpose of this repository is to implement my own version of the “Wa-Tor” simulation
## Implemantation
The project must be implemented on Linux using the gcc compiler and documented with Doxygen. This simulation must use openMP for parallelization. If
you wish to run this on a GPU then either CUDA or openMP may be used. The
simulation must show a simple graphical output representing the population at
each step.
